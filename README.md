Create your bot by giving it name and avatar!
• To name your bot as "YourBot", type `!tfb un YourBot`<br>
• To set your bot's "DiscordIsGenius" password, type `!tfb pwd DiscordIsGenius`<br>
• Finally to define the avatar, therefore the profile image of your bot, enter for example `!tfb avatar https://unviededev.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discord-1.png`<br>
You can so use `!tfb all YourBot DiscordIsGenius https://unviededev.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/discord-1.png`<br>
• To validate the creation of your bot, type "!tfb finish"<br>

### Step 2:
For connect to your bot, type `!tfb log <un> <pwd>`; here `!tfb log YourBot DiscordIsGenius`<br>
For disconnect, type `!tfb dsc`<br>
For send message, type `!tfb <msg>`. For example, to obtain this result :<br>
